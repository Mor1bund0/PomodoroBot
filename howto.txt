__Guide to using MarinaraBot Timer__

Another way to see the functions of the bot is to type `!help`

------ Checking Existing Timers ------

**!timers**
```
    With this, you'll be able to see the active timers, and check if any of them suit the
    way you want to study.
    If you decide to join one that's already active, skip to step 4.
    Else, follow the 'How to Set Up' secion
```


------ How to Set Up ------

**!timer setup**

```
    This command is used to set up the channel's timer to suit your needs.
    If you do not specify a setup, or if your specified setup is 'default' (No quotes),
    the default one for the channel will be used.
    The defaults are:
        #1_study-session - 32/8/15  (2x)
        #2_study-session - 45/15/20 (2x)
        #3_unmuted-study - 32/8/15  (2x)

    Custom timer setups are achieved by executing '!timer setup <string>'
    Where <string> is a list of 'Name:Time' pairs separated by commas, each representing a period.
    It also supports repeating groups, in the format of (Nx<PAIRS>), which results in N sets of the
    specified <PAIRS>. (Ex: (3xA:5,B:10,C:15) results in a period sequence of 5,10,15,5,10,15,5,10,15
    with their respective names).

    An example for a custom setup would be:
        (2xStudy:32,Break:8),Study:32,Long_Break:15

    Which would give the same as the default for session channels 1 and 3. It is recommended
    that if you do not understand how to apply custom setups, modify the example given, or simply do
    '!timer setup' (Again, no quotes).
```
