# Timer settings
timer:

  # The time, in seconds, at which the timer should tick. 2 is recommended, as 1 second will get the bot rate-limited.
  time_step: 2
  # Whether period looping should be set to 'on' or 'off' by default
  looping_default: True
  # Whether countdown mode should be enabled or disabled by default
  countdown_default: True

  # A list of the channels where timers are allowed and the setup for each channel.
  #  They are grouped by server ID then channel ID.
  #  The setup linked to them are the periods that are set if 'default' or no setup is given.
  #   They are channel-specific. If a channel has no setup configured, it will use the one hard-coded into the
  #   program.
  #
  # PLEASE MAKE SURE THE SPECIFIED DEFAULT SETUPS ARE VALID. THE BOT WILL FAIL WITH 'default' SPECIFIED, OTHERWISE.
